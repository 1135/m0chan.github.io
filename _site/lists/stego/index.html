Here is a list of the most tools I use and some other useful resources. Note : This list will be updated regularly , feel free to pm if you have any suggestions Last update : 29.1.2019 Tools Steghide Steghide is a steganography program that hides data in various kinds of image and audio files , only supports these file formats : JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU. but it’s also useful for extracting embedded and encrypted data from other files. It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github. Useful commands: steghide info file : displays info about a file whether it has embedded data or not. steghide extract -sf file : extracts embedded data from a file Foremost Foremost is a program that recovers files based on their headers , footers and internal data structures , I find it useful when dealing with png images. It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github. Useful commands: foremost -i file : extracts data from the given file. Stegsolve Sometimes there is a message or a text hidden in the image itself and in order to view it you need to apply some color filters or play with the color levels. You can do it with GIMP or Photoshop or any other image editing software but stegsolve made it easier. it’s a small java tool that applies many color filters on images. Personally i find it very useful You can get it from github Strings Strings is a linux tool that displays printable strings in a file. That simple tool can be very helpful when solving stego challenges. Usually the embedded data is password protected or encrypted and sometimes the password is actaully in the file itself and can be easily viewed by using strings It’s a default linux tool so you don’t need to install anything. Useful commands: strings file : displays printable strings in the given file. Exiftool Sometimes important stuff is hidden in the metadata of the image or the file , exiftool can be very helpful to view the metadata of the files. You can get it from here Useful commands: exiftool file : shows the metadata of the given file Exiv2 A tool similar to exiftool. It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github. Official website Useful commands: exiv2 file : shows the metadata of the given file Binwalk Binwalk is a tool for searching binary files like images and audio files for embedded files and data. It can be installed with apt however the source can be found on github. Useful commands: binwalk file : Displays the embedded data in the given file binwalk -e file : Displays and extracts the data from the given file Zsteg zsteg is a tool that can detect hidden data in png and bmp files. to install it : gem install zsteg , The source can be found on github Useful commands: zsteg -a file : Runs all the methods on the given file zsteg -E file : Extracts data from the given payload (example : zsteg -E b4,bgr,msb,xy name.png) Wavsteg WavSteg is a python3 tool that can hide data and files in wav files and can also extract data from wav files.
