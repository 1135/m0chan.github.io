## About Me

I am known as m0chan/mochan online & Aidan in real life - I have a strong passion to persue a career in Cyber Security with the end goal being able to be apart of a Red Team carrying out penetration testing. I created this GitHub so I have a platform to share my scripts, resources & finally to publish any CTF/VulnHub writeups. 

## HackTheBox Writeups

As I am aiming to become OSCP certified and undertake the dreaded OSCP course at some point I work on HackTheBox boxes and aim to root as many as I possibly can! Below you can find writeups of retired boxes which I have succesfully rooted / gained system privs on. 

*Any boxes with 'Coming Soon' means I have rooted / gained system privs on the box however it is has not yet been retired by HTB*

* Valentine - [Link](http://m0chan.github.io/HackTheBox/ValentineHTB)
* Sunday - Coming Soon
* Poison - Coming Soon
* Bounty - Coming Soon
* DevOops - Coming Soon
* Active - Coming Soon
* Waldo - Coming Soon


## Access All My Resources

Over the past few months I have been self-studying ALOT as I work towards increasing my penetration testing skills - I am slowly amassing a huge amount of resources relating to everything Cyber Security + Penetration Testing. I shared my Dropbox on Reddit and it got a huge amount of attention so I feel as if I should share it here as well.
