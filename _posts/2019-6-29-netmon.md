### Quick Summary
#### Hey guys today Netmon retired and here's my writeup about it. It was a very easy machine that's everything I can say about it. It's a Windows box and its ip is 10.10.10.152, I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `netmon.htb`. Let's jump right in !

### Nmap
#### As always we will start with `nmap` to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC netmon.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/1.png)
#### We got `ftp` on port 21, `http` on port 80 and `smb`. The most interesting thing is that anonymous login is allowed on `ftp` and obviously it's running on `C:` !

### FTP, User Flag
#### I checked that `ftp` server and got the user flag for `Public` :
```

#### PRTG Credentials
#### I checked the `http` service and found a web application called PRTG Network Monitor. However we need credentials to access the application.
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/3.png)
#### We have access to `C:` through the `ftp` server so we can search for credentials there. I searched for the place where PRTG configuration files are saved and found it was in `C:\Users\All Users\Application Data\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor` so I went there and downloaded the configuration files :

#### Knowing that the default admin user for PRTG is `prtgadmin` I searched for that string in the 3 configuration files :
`cat * | grep -A 20 -B 20 "prtgadmin"`
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/4.png)
#### I got the password which was `PrTg@dmin2018` :
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/5.png)
#### However it didn't work, after some attempts I changed it to `PrTg@dmin2019` and it worked :

### RCE, Root Flag
#### After searching for authenticated exploits I found [`CVE-2018-9276`](https://github.com/wildkindcc/CVE-2018-9276) which was an authenticated `RCE` vulnerability. I used [this exploit](https://github.com/M4LV0/PRTG-Network-Monitor-RCE) which exploits the `RCE` and creates a new Administrator user (This works because PRTG runs as `system`) :
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/8.png)
#### New user credentials : `pentest:P3nT3st!`. I used `psexec.py` from [`impacket`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) to get a shell :
`psexec.py pentest:'P3nT3st!'@netmon.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/netmon/9.png)
#### And we owned root !
#### That's it , Feedback is appreciated !
