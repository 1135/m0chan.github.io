They just go explaining what’s a buffer overflow without explaining what is a buffer , what is a stack or what are memory addresses etc. And I just wanted to make it easier for someone who wants to learn about it to find an article that covers the basics. So what I’m going to talk about in this article is what is a buffer , what is a stack and what are the memory addresses and we will take a look at the application memory structure , what is a buffer overflow and why does it happen then I’ll show a really basic and simple example for exploiting a buffer overflow (protostar stack0)</h4>

Simply a buffer is a memory place or location which is used by a running program. This memory location is used to store some temporary data that is being used by the program. So for example if we have a simple program that asks the user to enter his name and stores it in a variable called <em>username</em> then it prints “Hello <em>username</em> “ . For example if we run the program and enter username as “Rick”. The word “Rick” is stored in the buffer until the program executes the print command and it retrieves the given username “Rick” from the buffer to output the result : “Hello Rick”</h4>

Now you might already figured out why and when does a buffer overflow happen. A buffer overflow happens when the length of the data entered exceeds the buffer limit and this causes the program to write data outside the allocated buffer area and may overwrite some parts of the memory that were used to hold data used by the program which makes it unavailable and causes the program to crash. To demonstrate this we will go back to our first example.</h4>
