Now with stack3 we are given the source code but We are not going to use it, Instead of that we will use some practical techniques to solve this challenge. Because in a real situation we won’t have the source of the program right ? Let’s see</h4>

That memory address is stored in a variable and we can overwrite that variable when we exceed the buffer. We see that the function pointer was calling the address <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x41414141</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x41</code> is the hex of “A”. Now we have to do two things. The first thing is to know where the buffer overflow happens, Because here we have given the program an argument of 100 chars but we don’t know exactly the size of the buffer. The second thing is to find the memory address of the function that we need to execute. Let’s see how to do that.</h4>
