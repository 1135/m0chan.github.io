title: Bypassing 2FA For Fun with Evilginx2
published: true
---

## [](#header-2)Introduction

I recently decided to explore phishing techniques and 2FA Bypasses to further understand how attackers are compromising accounts/networks with 2FA enabled and to further demonstrate why organisation should not solely rely on 2FA to protect there sensitive assets. 

Of course there are convential phishing techniques where an attacker can clone a login interface, host it on there own web server and siphon the credentials but 2FA mitigate's this... Then I discovered Evilginx2 - Evilginx2 is a little bit different in the sense that it acts as a MITM-Proxy connecting to 2FA protected sites and handling the authenticating itself and merely just acting as a passthrough from the victim -> server. The below images provides a good picture.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2)Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
