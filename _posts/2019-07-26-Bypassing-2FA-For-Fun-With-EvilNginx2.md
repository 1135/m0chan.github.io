title: Bypassing 2FA For Fun with Evilginx2
published: true
---

## [](#header-2)Introduction

I recently decided to explore phishing techniques and 2FA Bypasses to further understand how attackers are compromising accounts/networks with 2FA enabled and to further demonstrate why organisation should not solely rely on 2FA to protect there sensitive assets. 

Of course there are conventional phishing techniques where an attacker can clone a login interface, host it on there own web server and siphon the credentials but 2FA mitigate's this... Then I discovered Evilginx2 - Evilginx2 is a little bit different in the sense that it acts as a MITM-Proxy connecting to 2FA protected sites and handling the authenticating itself and merely just acting as a passthrough from the victim -> server. The below images provides a good picture.

Evilginx2 has the ability to bypass 2FA on Outlook, Linkedin, O365, Twitter, Instagram, Github, Amazing, Reddit, Facebook & more...

Once I found out about Evilginx2 I had to try it for myself so as the Github said I opt'd for a VPS with Digital Ocean. You can use my referral link here & get $50 free credit (Enough for 1 Month VPS )[https://m.do.co/c/aa9fa82f580a](Digital Ocean Referral).



I also picked myself up a domain for testing purposes (https://offffice.co.uk) - Yes I managed to get 'Office' with 4 F's for Â£1... 



Now I was armed with a Ubuntu box & a domain I was ready to start configuring Evilnginx2 & start phishing :)

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
